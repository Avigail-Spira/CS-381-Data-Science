# CS-381-Data-Science
This repo contains multiple projects from my data science class where we analyzed data using python.   

Projects contain:
* A Data Summary section
* Comprehensive EDA which tells a story with the data
* Logistic regression (Logit) model and a classification "vector"
* Evaluation/performance metrics (Precision, Accuracy, Recall, Specificity, and F1 score)
* Shows that the data is imbalanced and uses SMOTE to fix the issue
* Retest of logistic regression model with the newly SMOTE data
* Retest of evaluation/performance metrics 
* Chi-square and p-values
* Model using either SVM or KNN
* A summary of the approach and conclusions made from gathered data
